# Implementing process-payment for Decrypting Credit Card meta_data in JWT with a Python Script

In this section, I will guide you through the process of writing a Python script from scratch to implement the process of decrypting credit card meta_data from a JWT. This step-by-step explanation will also include logic on how to collect and analyze the necessary information.

# Requirements for the Implementation:

# JWT Creation and Decryption:

We need to create, verify, and decode a JSON Web Token (JWT) that carries the encrypted credit card information (meta_data).
Encryption and Decryption Using AWS KMS:

We will use AWS KMS (Key Management Service) to encrypt and decrypt the credit card information securely.

# Data Flow:

The client sends an encrypted credit card token in the JWT.
The server (Payment Gateway) decrypts the token and processes the payment.
Steps to Collect Information:
Credit Card Information: This sensitive information must be encrypted using AWS KMS.

# JWT Information:

iss (Issuer): The unique identifier for the issuer (could be the payment processing service).
aud (Audience): Intended recipient of the JWT (e.g., the Payment Gateway).
iat (Issued At): Timestamp when the JWT was created.
exp (Expiration Time): Time after which the JWT expires.
meta_data: Contains the encrypted credit card data (from the client side).

# AWS KMS Configuration:

You will need access to AWS KMS with the following:
A KMS Key for encryption.
The same key for decryption on the server side.

# Logic Breakdown:

The JWT is signed on the client side with a private key.
The Payment Gateway will verify the JWT and decrypt the encrypted meta_data to process the payment.

# Python Libraries Required:

boto3: AWS SDK for Python (for working with AWS KMS).
PyJWT: Python library to encode and decode JWT tokens.
cryptography: Optional, for handling encryption tasks.


# Install these libraries using pip:
pip install boto3 PyJWT cryptography


# Step 1: Setup AWS KMS for Encryption and Decryption

Before implementing the code, ensure you have the following from AWS:

KMS Key ID: You need this to encrypt and decrypt data.
IAM Permissions: Ensure the Python script has the necessary AWS permissions to use the KMS key.

# Step 2: Script to Encrypt Data and Create JWT (Client-Side)

import boto3
import jwt
import time
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

// AWS KMS client
kms_client = boto3.client('kms', region_name='us-east-1')

// KMS Key ID (You should replace this with your actual KMS key ID)
KMS_KEY_ID = 'your-kms-key-id'

// Credit card data (this would be sensitive information)
credit_card_data = {
    'card_number': '4111111111111111',
    'expiry_date': '12/25',
    'cvv': '123'
}

// Function to encrypt data using AWS KMS
def encrypt_credit_card_data(data):
    response = kms_client.encrypt(
        KeyId=KMS_KEY_ID,
        Plaintext=json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8')  # Convert data to bytes
    )
    return response['CiphertextBlob']

// Create a JWT with encrypted credit card data in meta_data
def create_jwt():
    encrypted_data = encrypt_credit_card_data(credit_card_data)
    
    // JWT payload
    payload = {
        'iss': 'payment-service',  # Unique identifier for the issuer
        'aud': 'payment-gateway',  # Intended audience
        'iat': int(time.time()),  # Issued at time
        'exp': int((datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=30)).timestamp()),  # Expiration time
        'meta_data': encrypted_data  # Encrypted credit card data
    }
    
    // Signing the JWT (using RS256 with private key)
    private_key = open('private.pem').read()  # Load your private key
    token = jwt.encode(payload, private_key, algorithm='RS256')
    
    return token

// Create the JWT
jwt_token = create_jwt()
print(f"Generated JWT Token: {jwt_token}")

# Step 3: Verify and Decrypt JWT (Server-Side)

In this section, we'll focus on the server-side processing. After the client sends the signed JWT, the server (Payment Gateway) must:

Verify the JWT signature.
Decrypt the encrypted credit card data.

import jwt
import boto3
import base64

// AWS KMS client
kms_client = boto3.client('kms', region_name='us-east-1')

// Load public key for JWT signature verification
public_key = open('public.pem').read()  # Load your public key

// Function to decrypt the encrypted credit card data using AWS KMS
def decrypt_credit_card_data(encrypted_data):
    response = kms_client.decrypt(
        CiphertextBlob=encrypted_data
    )
    decrypted_data = response['Plaintext'].decode('utf-8')  # Decode the decrypted data
    return json.loads(decrypted_data)

// Function to verify JWT and extract meta_data
def process_jwt(jwt_token):
    try:
        # Verify JWT signature and extract payload
        decoded_jwt = jwt.decode(jwt_token, public_key, algorithms=['RS256'], audience='payment-gateway')

        # Decrypt meta_data
        encrypted_meta_data = decoded_jwt['meta_data']
        decrypted_meta_data = decrypt_credit_card_data(encrypted_meta_data)
        
        print(f"Decrypted Credit Card Data: {decrypted_meta_data}")
        
        # Proceed with payment processing logic here...

    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        print("JWT has expired.")
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        print("Invalid JWT.")

// Example of how to use the process_jwt function
received_jwt_token = 'REPLACE_WITH_RECEIVED_JWT'
process_jwt(received_jwt_token)

# Detailed Explanation of the Script:
1) Encrypt Credit Card Data:
    We use boto3 to interact with AWS KMS and encrypt the credit card details.
    The function encrypt_credit_card_data takes the credit card info and sends it to AWS KMS for encryption.
   
2) Create JWT:
    The encrypted credit card data is embedded in the meta_data field of the JWT payload.
    The JWT also includes standard claims like iss, aud, iat, and exp (issuer, audience, issued at time, and expiration time).
    The JWT is signed using the RS256 algorithm (using the private key), ensuring that the token is tamper-proof.

3) Verify and Decrypt JWT on the Server:
   The process_jwt function verifies the JWT signature using the public key.
   It extracts the meta_data field, which contains the encrypted credit card information.
    The decrypt_credit_card_data function uses AWS KMS to decrypt the meta_data, revealing the original credit card information.

4) Process Payment:
    After decrypting the credit card data, the server can proceed with payment processing logic (e.g., sending the decrypted card data to a payment processor).

# Security Considerations:

    JWT Expiry: Ensure the JWT has a short expiration time (exp) to prevent replay attacks.
    Secure Transmission: Always transmit JWT over secure channels (HTTPS) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    Minimal Data Exposure: Only store sensitive information in an encrypted format (meta_data), and decrypt it on the server-side just before processing the payment.
