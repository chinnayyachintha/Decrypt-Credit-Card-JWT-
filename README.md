# Decrypting Credit Card meta_data in JWT for Payment Processing

This section explains how to implement the process of decrypting credit card `meta_data` from a JSON Web Token (JWT) using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for secure payment processing.

## Overview

1. **JWT Creation and Decryption**: We use JWT for secure transmission of payment data between the client and server.
2. **AWS KMS**: Handles encryption and decryption of sensitive credit card data.
3. **Security**: RSA is used for signing JWT tokens, while AWS KMS ensures the security of sensitive information.
4. **Data Flow**: The client sends a JWT with encrypted credit card information, and the server decrypts and processes it.
